## Usage

#### Basic Usage

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with the template in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

#### Advanced Usage

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `gulp dev` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

## About

This is my personal portfolio in which I describe relevant facts about knowledge I have gained through my IT career. It is based on a free template and the modifications I have made have been uploaded in a public repo to create a GitHub page in order external people are able to visit this repo as a webpage (https://ntonx.github.io/). The credit for css files and html structure is for Blackrock Digital LLC. Personal credit is for changing content in html and in title icon.
